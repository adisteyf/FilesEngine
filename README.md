# Files Engine
### About Files Engine
This is open sourse **2D game** engine on java using `LWJGL` for Windows / macOS / linux.

### Info about releases
Im thinking about how to add 4 natives for `windows` and `linux`.

#### How colliders work:
- Find center of colliders.
- Subtract from **X** of main collider **X** of movable collider.
- It's the same with **Y**.
- Compare absolute of **X** and **Y**, which is bigger?
  - This is **X** and it's positive = **right** side.
  - This is **X** and it's negative = **left** side.
  - This is **Y** and it's positive = **bottom** side.
  - This is **Y** and it's negative = **top** side.

*Version: alpha-0.1.3*

**START fe-collector.sh ONLY IN "content root" (.../IdeaProjects/FilesEngine folder)**
